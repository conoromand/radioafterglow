what the code can do：
1. calculate jet dynamics (conical model of GP12) --> Gamma(t), R(t), theta(t)
2. calculate electron acceleration and synchrotron emissivity in the shocked region --> P'nu(t)
3. calculate "egg shape" for a given T_obs (Eq. 2 of GPS99) --> R_egg(mu)
4. integrate the emissivity along with the egg shape
5. repeat the calculations to obtain light curves and/or spectra
